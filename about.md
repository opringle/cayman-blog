Before training as a Data Scientist, I completed a Masters in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Bath in the UK.  During that time I spent a year working as a Stress Analyst for the Williams Formula One Team.

After moving to Canada in 2015, I decided to read a Masters in Data Science from the University of British Columbia.  Best decision I ever made.  I love this field! 

I currently work as a Data Scientist at finn.ai, specializing in natural language processing and deep learning.  We build conversational banking assistants, aimed at helping everyday people manage their finances. Think Google Assistant for your bank.

On the weekends you'll find me drinking fancy beer, riding downhill bikes, hiking into the backcountry on skis or hitting tennis balls around.
